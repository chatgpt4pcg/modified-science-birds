# Science Birds - Modified Version

This is a modified version of the [Science Birds](https://github.com/lucasnfe/science-birds) game. In this version, the foundational blocks have been adjusted to match with the grid specification of the competition, and a plugin has been added to convert the string of the `ab_drop()` function into an actual Science Birds level. The plugin can be accessed via the menu bar by selecting "ICE" and then choosing "Grid Level Converter MkIII."

## Usage
